# d3_lunch_and_learn

This holds all associated files for Neudesic's Lunch and Learn on d3.js (03/09/2018).



## Getting Started
Everything you need is provided here, so simply create a local copy of this repository and you should be good to go:

```
>> git clone https://github.com/jwilber/d3_lunch_and_learn.git
>> cd d3_lunch_and_learn
```

## Viewing the Files
To view the files on the browser, you'll need some sort of local server. I'm going to assume you have `npm`, in which case you can easily just install `http-server`.

```
# Install globally so we can run live-server from cli
npm install http-server -g
```

Once it's installed, just run `live-server` while inside the `d3_lunch_and_learn` directory.

Alternatively, if your machine has python and you don't want to add any `npm` stuff, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
